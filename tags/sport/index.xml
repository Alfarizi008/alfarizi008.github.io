      <description>What is trail running? Quote from Salomon websites:
Trail running is simply defined as going for a run in the heart of nature. It&amp;rsquo;s an extremely all-round non-stadia sport that, of course, works the legs, but also the upper body. Lastly, it requires concentration and attention.
Usually the track of trail running includes ascent and descents, rough terrain, hills, and many more so it make the sport more interesting yet challenging.</description>
